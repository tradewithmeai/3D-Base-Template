## 🔄 Current Session: Manual Room Build Protocol (2025-08-05)

**Git Tree Strategy:**
- `step-2-remove-add-cycle` branch: Contains session work with JSON fixes and factory simplification  
- `manual-room-build` branch: ✅ **ACTIVE** - Clean workspace for step-by-step manual construction
- **Rollback Protocol:** Use `git checkout step-2-remove-add-cycle` to restore session work if needed

**Essential Missing Stage Identified:** Manual construction with visual validation before factory automation

**Files Cleaned:**
- Removed: `component-manager.js`, `enhanced-components.json`, `test-component-catalog.html`, `test-logging-framework.html`
- Kept: `componentFactory.js` (simplified), `components.json` (flat), `room-layout.json` (will regenerate)

**Next:** Step-by-step room build with visual checks at each micro-step

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Future Validation Requirements

### Navigation/Collision Testing Gap
**Issue Identified:** Sanity Check G (Nav-mesh testing) uses raycasting but doesn't test actual character movement collision.
- **Current Test:** Raycasting from test points (incomplete validation)
- **Real Need:** Character movement around environment to verify walls actually block player
- **Status:** Too complex to implement during baseline validation phase
- **Action Required:** Must retest collision system once character movement is integrated back into factory system

**Critical Note:** The baseline JSON is structurally complete but movement collision validation is deferred until character integration phase.

## 🎉 BASELINE VALIDATION COMPLETE (2025-08-05)

### ✅ 100% RIGID BASELINE ACHIEVED
**Comprehensive Validation Results:**
- ✅ **Scene Integrity Confirmed** - All 9 objects created and positioned correctly

- ✅ **World Bounds Calculated** - Proper dimensional boundaries established
- 🏆 **RIGIDITY SCORE: 100%** - All automated validation checks passed

**Validation Method:** Step-by-step manual build with automated assertions + visual confirmation at each phase

### ⏳ DEFERRED VALIDATION ITEMS
**Items requiring character movement integration:**
- **Real Collision Testing** - Wall boundaries need character controller to validate properly

## 🎯 GITHUB CI/CD MIGRATION SUCCESS (2025-08-10)

### ✅ CHECKPOINT A & B COMPLETED - Professional CI/CD Architecture Implemented

**STRATEGIC PIVOT ACHIEVEMENT:**
After encountering cascading failures in first-person movement integration (where fixing one issue broke another due to monolithic 1300+ line architecture), we successfully pivoted to implementing a professional GitHub CI/CD pipeline to prevent regression issues and enable sustainable development.

### ✅ CHECKPOINT A: SCAFFOLD + GIT LFS (COMPLETED)
**ZERO FUNCTIONAL CHANGES - PURE INFRASTRUCTURE:**

**✅ Git LFS Configuration:**
- Initialized Git LFS for binary asset management 
- Created `.gitattributes` with proper filters for `.glb`, `.hdr` files
- Text normalization configured for cross-platform compatibility

**✅ Modular Directory Structure:**
```
3d-mall/
├── .nvmrc (Node 20)
├── .gitattributes (Git LFS config)
├── README.md (minimal scaffold note)
├── src/
│   ├── manual-room-build.html (beth-builder)
│   ├── index.html (main app)
│   ├── componentFactory.js
│   ├── components.json
│   ├── room-layout.json
│   └── logging-framework.js
├── schemas/ (empty, ready for B)

│   └── visual/ (empty, ready for C)
├── tools/ (empty, ready for B)
└── .github/
    └── workflows/ (empty, ready for B)
```

**✅ Sanity Check Results:**
- ✅ `src/manual-room-build.html` loads correctly (HTTP 200)
- ✅ `src/index.html` loads correctly (HTTP 200)
- ✅ No broken paths or functional regressions
- ✅ Local development server operational

### ✅ CHECKPOINT B: SCHEMAS + UNIT CI (COMPLETED)  
**COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION SYSTEM WITH ZERO FUNCTIONAL CHANGES:**

**✅ JSON Schema Validation System:**
- **`schemas/components.schema.json`** - Strict validation for component definitions (model types, size arrays, material colors, collision flags)
- **`schemas/room-layout.schema.json`** - Validation for room instance layouts (position arrays, rotation arrays, type references)
- **`tools/validate-json.js`** - AJV-based validator with clear error reporting and ES module support

**✅ Unit Test Framework:**
- **`src/lib/coords.ts`** - Pure coordinate conversion utilities (corner-based → Three.js center positioning)
- **`tests/unit/coords.spec.ts`** - Comprehensive test coverage with 9 test cases covering floor, ceiling, and wall placement
- **Zero Three.js dependencies** in unit tests (pure mathematical functions only)
- **Real-world validation** against actual `room-layout.json` coordinates

**✅ CI Pipeline (Two Jobs):**
- **schema job**: Validates `components.json` and `room-layout.json` against schemas
- **unit job**: Runs coordinate conversion unit tests
- **Node.js version management**: Uses `.nvmrc` for consistent environment
- **Dependency caching**: npm cache optimization for faster builds
- **Parallel execution**: Both jobs run simultaneously for speed

**✅ Development Tooling:**
- **`package.json`** with vitest, typescript, ajv dependencies
- **`tsconfig.json`** configured for ES2020/ESNext with strict type checking
- **npm scripts**: `test:schema`, `test:unit`, `test` (runs both)
- **ES module support** throughout the toolchain

### 📊 COMPREHENSIVE TEST RESULTS

**Local Test Validation:**
```bash
✅ Schema validation: 2/2 files valid
  - components.json: ✅ All component definitions valid
  - room-layout.json: ✅ All instance layouts valid

✅ Unit tests: 9/9 tests passing
  - Floor positioning: ✅ (center calculation)
  - Ceiling positioning: ✅ (height placement) 
  - Wall positioning: ✅ (north/south/east/west)
  - Error handling: ✅ (invalid wall types)
  - Real-world validation: ✅ (matches actual JSON)

✅ CI Pipeline: Both jobs passing
  - schema job: 9s execution time
  - unit job: 11s execution time
```

**GitHub Actions Results:**
- **PR #1**: https://github.com/tradewithmeai/3D-Base-Template/pull/1
- **✅ schema check**: JSON validation passed (9s)
- **✅ unit check**: Coordinate tests passed (11s)
- **Zero functional regressions**: Pages still load correctly

### 🐛 FAILURES AND FIXES ENCOUNTERED

**❌ FAILURE 1: Git LFS Command Rejection**
- **Error**: Initial `git lfs install` command was rejected
- **Root Cause**: User permissions hadn't been updated yet
- **Fix**: User updated permissions, retry successful
- **Prevention**: Always check permission settings before LFS operations

**❌ FAILURE 2: ES Module vs CommonJS Conflict**
- **Error**: `ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope`
- **Root Cause**: `package.json` had `"type": "module"` but validator used CommonJS syntax
- **Fix**: Updated `tools/validate-json.js` to use ES module imports
- **Code Fix**: 
  ```javascript
  // Before (CommonJS)
  const fs = require('fs');
  
  // After (ES Modules)
  import fs from 'fs';
  import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
  const __dirname = path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));
  ```
- **Prevention**: Maintain consistent module system throughout project

**❌ FAILURE 3: PR Creation Against Non-Existent Branch**
- **Error**: `No commits between iterate-next and ci-bootstrap`
- **Root Cause**: `iterate-next` branch didn't exist on remote, only locally
- **Fix**: Created PR against available base branch (`wip-post-v1`)
- **Prevention**: Check remote branch availability with `git branch -r` before PR creation

**❌ FAILURE 4: CLI Command Timeout Issues**
- **Error**: Git push timeouts during large file operations
- **Root Cause**: Network latency with npm package-lock.json and node_modules
- **Fix**: Extended timeout and broke operations into smaller chunks
- **Prevention**: Use `.gitignore` for large generated files, push smaller changesets

### 🎯 TECHNICAL INNOVATIONS ACHIEVED

**🔧 Coordinate System Validation:**
- Built comprehensive test suite validating our corner-based coordinate system
- Proven mathematical accuracy of our spatial positioning algorithms
- Established foundation for future AI agent spatial understanding

- Complete validation at each checkpoint before proceeding
- Stop and report progress rather than rushing to completion

**✅ ZERO FUNCTIONAL CHANGES DISCIPLINE:**
- Infrastructure changes should never modify application behavior
- Always validate that existing functionality remains intact
- Scaffold first, then build upon solid foundations

**✅ PROPER ERROR HANDLING:**
- ES module vs CommonJS conflicts are common in modern Node.js
- Always test locally before pushing to CI
- Clear error messages prevent debugging struggles

**✅ STRATEGIC PIVOTS:**
- When tactical fixes create more problems, step back and solve strategically
- Monolithic architectures require systematic refactoring, not patches
