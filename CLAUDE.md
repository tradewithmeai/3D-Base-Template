## 🚀 Future Development Plans

### 📅 Next Session Goals

#### 🏗️ Modular Architecture Refactoring
**High Priority - Ready to Build:**
- **Component-based system** for easy client customization
- **Gallery module** - easily swap artworks, frames, and lighting
- **Character module** - add/remove/modify characters with simple config
- **Environment module** - change office layouts, furniture, and themes
- **Lighting module** - customize ambient, accent, and mood lighting
- **Interactive module** - add/remove interactive elements

**Technical Approach:**
```javascript
// Modular system example
const GalleryModule = {
    artworks: [...],
    create: () => { /* gallery creation */ },
    update: (newArtworks) => { /* swap content */ },
    remove: () => { /* cleanup */ }
};
```

#### 🏢 Office Expansion Ideas
**Medium Priority:**
- **Lounge Area:** Comfortable seating with couches and coffee tables
- **Meeting Rooms:** Conference tables with presentation screens
- **Kitchen/Break Room:** Enhanced coffee station, fridges, microwaves
- **Library Corner:** Bookshelves with technical books and reading area
- **Gaming Zone:** Arcade machines or console setup for breaks

#### 🎮 Interactive Features
**Medium-High Priority:**
- **Clickable objects:** Interactive computers, coffee machines, whiteboards
- **Working elevator/doors** with smooth animations
- **Aquarium or fish tank** with swimming fish animations
- **Window views** showing cityscape or nature scenes
- **Weather system** affecting lighting and ambiance

#### 🤖 Character & AI Improvements
**Low-Medium Priority:**
- **More diverse characters** with different roles and personalities
- **Advanced AI conversations** using OpenAI API for dynamic responses
- **Character backstories** and personality-driven interactions
- **Meeting simulations** where characters interact with each other
- **Skill demonstrations** - characters showing their work

### 📊 Content Management
