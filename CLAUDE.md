## üéØ Latest Achievements (2025-08-15)

### ‚úÖ CHECKPOINT C1: PLAYWRIGHT VISUAL TESTING HARNESS COMPLETE
**SYSTEMATIC CI/CD PIPELINE ENHANCEMENT:**
- **üé≠ Playwright Integration** - Visual regression testing system with deterministic screenshot capture
- **üîß Three-Job CI Pipeline** - Parallel execution of schema, unit, and visual testing workflows
- **üì∏ Baseline Screenshot System** - Cross-platform baseline generation with strict 0.002 pixel tolerance
- **üåê GitHub Actions Enhancement** - Pull request automation with Node 20 environment consistency
- **üéØ Scope-Pure Implementation** - Zero runtime code changes, maintaining application integrity

### ‚úÖ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
**PLAYWRIGHT VISUAL TESTING SYSTEM:**
- **Configuration**: `playwright.config.js` with Chromium headless mode (1280x720 viewport)
- **Test Strategy**: Canvas element detection + 2s render completion wait for 3D scene stability
- **Baseline Management**: Windows baseline generated locally, Linux baseline auto-generated in CI
- **Visual Tolerance**: `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.002` for precise regression detection
- **CI Integration**: Ubuntu-latest with Python HTTP server for local file serving

### ‚úÖ CI/CD PIPELINE ARCHITECTURE
**THREE-JOB PARALLEL EXECUTION:**
1. **schema**: JSON schema validation (placeholder - ready for future schemas)
2. **unit**: Coordinate utility testing (placeholder - ready for future unit tests)  
3. **visual**: Playwright visual regression testing (full implementation)

**DEPLOYMENT SPECIFICATIONS:**
- **Trigger**: Pull request events to `iterate-next` branch
- **Environment**: Node 20 (via .nvmrc), npm ci for consistent dependencies
- **Performance**: Target <60s total pipeline duration
- **Dependencies**: Minimal `@playwright/test` addition, zero bloat

### üõ†Ô∏è FAILURES ENCOUNTERED & FIXES APPLIED

#### **‚ùå FAILURE 1: Wrong File Path in Visual Test**
- **Error**: `404 File not found` for `/src/index.html`
- **Root Cause**: Test assumed `src/` directory structure, but `index.html` is in root
- **Fix**: Updated test path from `http://localhost:3000/src/index.html` to `http://localhost:3000/index.html`
- **Lesson**: Always verify actual file structure before assuming paths

#### **‚ùå FAILURE 2: Git Authentication Timeouts**
- **Error**: `git push` operations timing out during large file uploads
- **Root Cause**: Manual GitHub account selection required for authentication
- **Fix**: User manually selected account when prompted, subsequent pushes succeeded
- **Prevention**: Authentication handled proactively in future sessions

#### **‚ùå FAILURE 3: CI Workflow Not Triggering**
- **Error**: `no checks reported on the 'feature/checkpoint-c1' branch`
- **Root Cause**: GitHub Actions requires workflow to exist on base branch before PR triggers work
- **Status**: Workflow created in feature branch but needs base branch merge to activate
- **Resolution Path**: Requires separate workflow-enablement PR to `iterate-next`

#### **‚ùå FAILURE 4: Package.json Configuration**
- **Error**: Minimal package.json created by npm only included devDependencies
- **Root Cause**: Fresh branch had no existing package.json structure
- **Fix**: Created complete package.json with proper scripts, metadata, and Playwright dependency
- **Validation**: Added placeholder scripts for schema and unit tests to match CI expectations

#### **‚ùå FAILURE 5: PR Scope Contamination**
- **Error**: PR diff showing unintended files (CLAUDE.md, archive files)
- **Root Cause**: GitHub comparing against different base branch state than local
- **Mitigation**: Added `.gitignore` to exclude test-results and local config files
- **Status**: Core implementation clean, display issue remains (GitHub base comparison)

### ‚úÖ SYSTEMATIC PROBLEM-SOLVING APPROACH
**PROFESSIONAL ERROR HANDLING:**
- **Incremental Testing** - Each component validated independently before integration
- **Deterministic Solutions** - Canvas detection + fixed wait times for consistent 3D scene capture
- **Scope Discipline** - Strict adherence to C1-only changes, no runtime modifications
- **Documentation** - Complete error logging with root cause analysis and prevention strategies
- **Git Hygiene** - Force-push of clean implementation, proper .gitignore configuration

- ‚úÖ CI workflow with 3 parallel jobs (schema, unit, visual)
- ‚úÖ Clean scope with only intended files committed
- ‚úÖ PR created and updated with force-push of clean implementation

**üìã DELIVERABLES COMPLETED:**
- **PR URL**: https://github.com/tradewithmeai/3D-Base-Template/pull/3
- **Files Added**: `.nvmrc`, `package.json`, `playwright.config.js`, `tests/visual/`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Local Testing**: ‚úÖ Playwright test executes successfully (7.1s)
- **Baseline Generated**: ‚úÖ Windows baseline created for CI cross-validation

### üöÄ READY FOR NEXT PHASE: CI VALIDATION
**PENDING ITEMS FOR FULL ACTIVATION:**
- **CI Enablement**: Merge workflow to base branch for GitHub Actions activation
- **Linux Baseline**: CI will generate proper Linux baseline when triggered
- **Visual Regression**: System ready for detecting 3D scene changes with precision
- **Branch Protection**: CI checks can be required before merge once workflow is active

## üîÑ Current Session: Manual Room Build Protocol (2025-08-05)

**Git Tree Strategy:**
- `step-2-remove-add-cycle` branch: Contains session work with JSON fixes and factory simplification  
- `manual-room-build` branch: ‚úÖ **ACTIVE** - Clean workspace for step-by-step manual construction
- **Rollback Protocol:** Use `git checkout step-2-remove-add-cycle` to restore session work if needed

**Essential Missing Stage Identified:** Manual construction with visual validation before factory automation

**Files Cleaned:**
- Removed: `component-manager.js`, `enhanced-components.json`, `test-component-catalog.html`, `test-logging-framework.html`
- Kept: `componentFactory.js` (simplified), `components.json` (flat), `room-layout.json` (will regenerate)

**Next:** Step-by-step room build with visual checks at each micro-step

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Future Validation Requirements

### Navigation/Collision Testing Gap
**Issue Identified:** Sanity Check G (Nav-mesh testing) uses raycasting but doesn't test actual character movement collision.
- **Current Test:** Raycasting from test points (incomplete validation)
- **Real Need:** Character movement around environment to verify walls actually block player
- **Status:** Too complex to implement during baseline validation phase
- **Action Required:** Must retest collision system once character movement is integrated back into factory system

**Critical Note:** The baseline JSON is structurally complete but movement collision validation is deferred until character integration phase.
